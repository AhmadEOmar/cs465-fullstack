CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

# Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
+ We created the customer facing section of the site using Express HTML which used handlebars to render the information the user saw.
+ JavaScript was used for both the front-end and backend of the project which was mostly what was used to code the website.
+ Single-page Application was used so that the website does not have to keep getting data from the database when it loads at once which allowed us to create a better feeling website since it's faster and more responsive on the userâ€™s end. 


# Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
+ We used NoSQL MongoDB because of the ease of use but also the ease of modifying the data, MongoDB is also able to easily be scaled up or down to meet the needs that we have instead of being forced to use a certain size of database. 

# How is JSON different from JavaScript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
+ JSON is how we can easily read data with JavaScript and into databases which allows us to connect the frontend and backend of the program together. 

# Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
+ We did this with the trip card listing in which we created a new way on how we showed the trip data which allowed us to create a faster and more efficient trip listing because we were reusing components instead of creating new components every time, we created a new listing. This helps us to reduce the size of the website, which allows the website to run faster due to that smaller file size but also makes it more responsive. 

# Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
+ We created a few ways of adding, editing, and deleting data before we focused on securityh in which before adding the security anyone would be able to access those API endpoints which would have allowed them to gain access to data on the site that they should not have access to them but by us adding in those securities in which the user has to be logged in to access those API endpoints we reduce who can access those endpoints and change the data that will be stored in our database and show on the website. 

# How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
+ I worked as a frontend developer before going back to school but that was years ago which made me rusty with it and we also used technologies that I had not used before, so this was a great course as a refresher course but also a way to learn new technologies that I had not used before. If I want to go back as a front-end developer what I learned in this class will be vital for me.
